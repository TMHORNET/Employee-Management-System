Basically how to run the code successfully:
1.)	Install turbo C++ (because i made this project in this software so I prefer that you guys also you this | I prefer not to use any other softwares as it might give you some of the errors).
2.)	Make a EmployeeManagementSystem.c file in turbo C++
3.)	Copy and paste the code in your turbo c file and run it.
4.)	Code will run successfully
